05 Mar 2025 — Kick-off

Decided to initially search for review articles on ML in manufacturing; RL to search in two weeks.

Schedule a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation for next meeting.

09–18 Mar 2025 — Attention.

Collect introductory literature on manufacturing ML; organize 5-min presentations (scope, objectives, preliminary sources).

Outline RL sections to study for next meeting (basics, algos to cover).

20 Mar 2025 — Methodology & RL fundamentals.

Presented methodology PPT; discussed RL fundamentals.

Next steps: gather papers under MLR, XGBoost, Random Forest; read Q-learning, DDPG, TD3; begin literature survey.

24–31 Mar 2025 — Attention

Start literature review framework; collect supervised ML papers (MLR/XGBoost/RF) and introductory RL sources; outline EDA plan.

03 Apr 2025 — Prepare EDA & dataset

Shared targets and inputs; discussed data provenance.

Action: extensive EDA with plots; try first ML models; peruse Mg synthesis papers to give parameter background.

07–09 Apr 2025 — Focus

Conduct bivariate/multivariate EDA; prepare figures and text to communicate model choice.

10 Apr 2025 — Reviewed EDA; begin ML modeling.

EDA depth noted; urged to initiate ML models to aid RL; commence literature survey; read SMOTE and nanoparticle preparation thoroughly.

14–26 Apr 2025 — Focus 

Train baseline regressors; experiments with SMOTE; extend survey with literature background and model choice.

27 Apr 2025 — Modelling feedback & writing objectives.

EDA assessed as good; ML modeling direction is fine; SMOTE attempted but challenging.

Supervisor requested to write a stronger literature review (~3,000 words) and to use SMOTE; finalize entire interim report planning.

01–26 May 2025 — Pay attention (during meetings).

Literature review with additional references; progress towards interim report; finalize models; prepare tree of relevance, Gantt chart.

30 May 2025 — plan for literature review & first draft. Submitted draft literature review with references; model "fine".

Feedback: provide more references; integrate relevance tree; plan Gantt chart; finalize literature review and poster.
